# Lab Assignments

## How to Start
Run the following commands in your terminal window:

1. Create a virtual environment
```console
python -m virtualenv venv --python=python3.7
```
* If you have not installed virtualenv, do so by:
```console
python -m pip install virtualenv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment

   ```console
      venv/scripts/activate
   ```

3. Install all dependencies
```console
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that *Python 3.7* is used in the virtual environment
